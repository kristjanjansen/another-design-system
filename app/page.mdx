# Getting started

## Setting up tokens

First, create a Personal Access Token (classic) in GitHub: [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

Then, create a `.npmrc` file in your home directory (often referenced as `~/.npmrc`) with the following content:

```bash
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE
@enefit:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

If you do not want to edit `~/.npmrc` manually, you can also run the following command:

```sh
npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com --scope=@enefit
```
Username: YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME_HERE

Password: YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE

## Installation

Then, install the package in your project:

```bash
npm install @enefit/eds
```

## Setting up styles

First, import the styles in your main layout file:

```ts
import '@enefit/eds/styles.css';
```

## Import components

Then you can import the components you need:

```ts
import { Text } from '@enefit/eds'

export default function Page() {
    return <Text>Hello world!</Text>
}
```

## CI installation

To make the library accesible to CI systems such as Clourflare or Digital Ocean, create a `.npmrc` file in your project root with the following content:

```bash
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GITHUB_TOKEN}
@enefit:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

Then add the token to your environment configuration:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE
```
